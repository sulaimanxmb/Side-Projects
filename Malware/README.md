# Malware

This is a simple malware that steals targets Wifi and broser stored passwords I used a Udemy course for reference and not my own code
I used a tool called laZagne to help with this steal

Works if:
1. target is windows 
2. must have real time protection disabled in windows security
3. should have python and requests library installed
4. and should run the code
5. takes around 60-90 seconds to be executed
